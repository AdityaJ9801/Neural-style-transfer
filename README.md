# Neural-style-transfer

Neural style transfer is a technique that uses deep learning to combine the content of one image with the style of another image. For example, you can make a photo of a dog look like a painting by Picasso or Van Gogh. Neural style transfer works by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the features and statistics of both images and then optimize the output image to match them. Neural style transfer can create artistic and creative images that blend different styles and genres1
